###Converting Files

-----

The downloaded shapefile is a *binary* file, it does not permit easy human reading and editing. This makes it challenging to match our dataset to geographic features, since we are not able to see how any of the entities are named. Our first step will be to convert this file into something more usable.

Open a terminal, and move to the folder we prepared on your Desktop.

```cd ~/Desktop/ne_50m_admin_0_sovereignty/```
