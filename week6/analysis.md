###Dataset Analysis

---

There are many examples on the [Open Weather Map Realtime API](http://openweathermap.org/current) documentation page for accessing weather data in different ways.

We will be querying the API for several cities based on their IDs, which can be referenced in this [index](http://bulk.openweathermap.org/sample/city.list.json.gz) (beware: large download).
