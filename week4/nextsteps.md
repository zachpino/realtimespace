###Next Steps

-----

Try to run through all of the steps covered in this choropleth on your own with a different state and dataset. The javascript is still new, and will be challenging to understand for a while. The more time you spend with it, the more legible it will be. 

In addition, with the techniques covered this and last week, seek out shapefiles for your projects and produce some svg maps to prototype on in Illustrator.

Tomoko and Zach have made some decisions regarding student projects going forward. As we have expressed since the beginning of the course, we need to winnow the class projects down to a more managable number to ensure each project is adequately supported. We have decided that the following projects are adequately bolstered by appropriate data resources, and are feasibly scoped to the semester timeline.

The teams *do not necessarily need to work on a single result*. But, the teammates should be working together to source and coerce data into a format and codebase that both designers can implement. Please use teamwork to accelerate the research and hypothetical phases of the design process, and for peer review, coding help, and sanity-checks throughout the semester.

These will be the *supported* data sources. If another dataset would be useful to your project, you are encouraged to explore and implement it! But, given the limited numbers of hours in a day, Tomoko and Zach can only provide assistance across these cited topics and datasets.
