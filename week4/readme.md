###Choropleth

-----

This set of steps, based on a the process documented by Mike Bostock at [Command Line Cartography](<a href="/pages/policies">), allows anyone to pull down data form the Census data api and produce a simple choropleth visualization.

A choropleth is a type of data visualization logic that uses colored area to communicate quantified relationships. They are most often seen in polling visualizations (think redness or blueness of states during presidential elections), but can be used to clealy communicate anything that is representative of a spatial *area*.
